## LD4 Discovery Affinity Group

Discussion of linked-data discovery in libraries and archives.

## Rationale

There is a pressing need to provide concrete demonstrations of the benefits of linked data in order to help motivate the transition of library catalogs from MARC.  Within [LD4P3](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=187176106), work to enhance the discovery of library resources is the focus of WP3: Discovery. Within [LD4P2](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=104568167), similar work was the focus of [WP4: Discovery](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=101783940). The partners had committed to working with the [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) framework to demonstrate enhanced discovery features such as:

  1. knowledge panel in search results to present contextual information powered by linked data;
  2. browsing based on authority files and links to related entities in external data; 
  3. semantic search, which could include laying out alternative terms in a “no results” page, suggesting semantically related terms in a type-ahead, or providing richer, geo-based browse by leveraging URIs for places; and
  4. microdata on item pages to enable machine crawling.

In all of these areas there is opportunity for community input on and discussion of the best approaches and the desired outcomes. The LD4 Discovery Affinity Group will provide a forum for these discussions, with the following goals:

  * identify exemplar systems/features the demonstrate the benefits of linked data and could be applied to library resources
  * identify opportunities for enhanced discovery of library resources using linked data that can be implemented in the short to medium term
  * document connections between cataloging practices and discovery outcomes
  * document effective assessment approaches
  * provide advice to LD4P3 partners for WP3: Discovery (previously provided advice to LD4P2 partners and cohort members for [WP4: Discovery](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=101783940))

## Approach

  * Co-chaired by Astrid Usong & Huda Khan
    * Jessie Keck: co-chair from 2019 - 3/2021
    * Originally chartered and chaired by Tom Cramer and Simeon Warner
  * Bi-weekly calls (see below):
    * Announce on #general and #discovery
    * Public notes in Google Drive: [meeting minutes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Un3ALFr1zKROYr9b6h5VGX4Xikz6SqQC)
    * Topics seeded in advance, with a few key speakers drawn from community, then discussion
  * Dedicated, open Slack channel in LD4 – [`#discovery`](https://ld4.slack.com/archives/CFWB3FX9T)
  * Dedicated, open Google Group – [ld4-discovery](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ld4-discovery)
  * Share brief updates on all hands calls
  * Consider face-to-face sessions at the LD4 conference each Spring

As an [LD4 Affinity Group](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/ld4-community-site/groups), we are open to all, regardless of institutional or organizational affiliation.
